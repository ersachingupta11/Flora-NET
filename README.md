# Title 
Integrating Dual Coordinate Attention with Adaptive Kernel Based Convolution Network for Medicinal Flower Identification

# Problem Description
Medicinal flowers are vital part in the several domains like healthcare, cosmmetics, and many more. Accurate Classification of the medicinal flower is necessary to develop the precise herbs for disease ailments. Several deep learning methods have been deployed for classification but they fails to capture the long-range dependencies of the feature maps and hierarchical feature maps among the flora-images.

# Proposed Study
The proposed Flora-NET contains the three phases: Data-processing where the images have been uniformly resized to 224 x 224 followed by the conventional image augmentation methods. The second phase includes the DCAFE and inv-FR modules for better feature extraction and refinement. The third phase contains the classification module for flower identification.

# Result
The proposed Flora-NET method has been trained and tested on two publicly avaiable flower datasets: Urban Street and Medicinal Flower Blossom datasets. The results affirmed that the proposed method overshadows the exisiting methods for precise medicinal flower classification.
